PrintrCamBot v0.1  
============

An open-source 3D-printable **Dropcam carrier for Printrbot's challenge.**

Summary

My name is Carlos Garc√≠a Saura, and I'm a student from Spain. **I am a true fan of Printrbot, and I also love making robots, so you can imagine my face when I saw this:**

I would love to get my hands on a Printrbot Simple, maybe this could be my chance! :P  

Basically, my approach is based on two different ideas:  

- ~~Since the Dropcam has two-way audio incorporated, why not use that to send DTMF audio tones to control the robot? (more details below)~~  
- **A "flying fox" robot could easily travel around Printrbot's warehouse without disturbing their workspace** You would just need to place a tense wire from one side to the other of the place to monitor.  

**I would love to see this robot moving around Printrbot's HQ**  

(6 June 2013) DTMF discarded, new approach!  
--
Brook has told me that Dropcam's speaker can only be controlled by the owner (D'Oh!).  
So here is the new setup idea:  
- The robot is kept really simple: **Replace the DTMF board with a cheap Bluetooth module.** I can make a compact electronics board for this.
- **In any computer, plug a USB bluetooth dongle. A simple Python script will then communicate with both the robot AND Printrbot's server.** At first I thought of using a Raspberry Pi, but this is cheaper and will work as well! :)
- **At Printrbot's server, install a simple script. Its mission is to present users with a simple controller interface, and queue them for "time slots".** This way you can easily send commands to the robot from the server.

**The cost is still very low:** Arduino board in the robot (~15$) + Cheap Bluetooth Module (~$5) + Bluetooth USB dongle (~$10, free if you already have one!)  
And the robot itself could use *(depending on the design you finally choose)* three or four servos + a Li-Po battery (with 5V regulator).

(11 June 2013) Update: Pause!

Sadly, it won't be possible for me to develop the web interface (at least soon) :S  
I'm more of a hardware guy, so my first Web UI attempts have been a bit of a disaster! Not to mention that the code needs to be robust against hacker attacks: I have very little experience dealing with those kind of issues.  

Also, there is too many stuff for me to keep up with before I leave to the US next week (will be in California for two months).  
It would be great to have a Printrbot Simple that I can leave at my cousins place, so please let us know if we could have some discount! :)  

Anyway, it has been a honor to collaborate with this design and am willing to help with electronics/hardware :) Can't wait to control your Dropcam!  
Thank you Printrbot for promoting Open Source, and good luck to the rest of participants!  

Video (5 June 2013)

For this test, I fixed my Android Phone to the back of the robot, and added a heavy battery on the other side as a weight to stabilize the robot.
The additional weight plus the thin wire that I have used make the robot quite unstable (it is the first test, what did you expect? ;)  

I have then stabilished a call via Skype (for the DropCam, this will be done pressing the "Talk" button, and then using a DTMF generator on any smartphone, holding it next to the mic).  

The dial-up tones coming out from the speaker of the smartphone -I insist, this could be directly the Dropcam- are then interpreted by the DTMF decoder + Arduino Nano to move the servos.

**Unfortunately, I don't have a Dropcam to do proper tests. But as it is shown in the video, this robot can control a Dropcam via internet using its speaker.**

I have printed all the parts using my Printrbot Jr, which I bought last summer. **This printer feels very lonely and would love to have a Printrbot Simple as a friend :)**  
![ScreenShot](https://github.com/carlosgs/PrintrCamBot/raw/master/Media/Previous/2013-06-03 19.48.16.jpg)
The parts have been designed with OpenScad and are parametric, don't forget to add the real diameter of the Dropcam before printing!  

For the electronics, I have developed a DTMF decoder board and manufactured it in **Cyclone PCB Factory** (<https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory>). **It has been the first circuit manufactured with this new open-hardware machine! :P**  
If Printrbot likes my idea, I will send them the electronics assembled so they don't need to worry about it.

Regarding Dropcam's power supply
--
The tray of the robot has been designed to carry a medium-sized Li-Po battery, and also a 5V regulator. This would supply the 2A required by the Dropcam, and the few milliamps required by the rest of the robot.

To-Do list
--
- Add counter-balance weight for the main frame
- Add second "travel wheel" to improve stability
- Wait for Printrbot's feedback! :)
